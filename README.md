🚀 How the App Works (UI Flow)

A user lands on the homepage and sees featured hotels.

They browse the hotel listings and filter hotels based on their preferences.

Upon selecting a hotel, they are taken to the hotel details page, where they can view more info and available rooms.

The user clicks Book Now, filling in details like check-in date, check-out date, and number of guests.

A confirmation page shows a summary of the booking details.

⚠️ Note: This project contains only the frontend UI. No backend, authentication, or real payment gateway is integrated.
